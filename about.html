                      <p>
                      I will provide reliable legal advice, appropriate due diligence and carefully prepared agreements
                      and supporting documentation in order to ensure a smooth and successful sale or purchase of a

                      <p>
                      Commercial law has a significant impact on most aspects of running a business.  Carefully
                      drafted written agreements, such as employment agreements, help to avoid misunderstandings
                      down the road.

                      <h2 class="intro-text">Financing:</h2>
                      <p>
                      I can help you interpret and negotiate bank financing arrangements and to properly structure,
                      document and securitize credit arrangements.

                      <h2 class="intro-text">Commercial Real Estate:</h2>
                      <p>
                      Buying and selling commercial real estate involves special risks that donâ€™t arise, for example, on
                      the purchase or sale of a home.  I can help you to draft purchase and sale agreements and
                      facilitate closings.  I can also assist with leasing arrangements and preparation of leases.

                      <h2 class="intro-text">Wills:</h2>
                      <p>
                      A Will is an essential part of any estate plan.  I can help you develop a scheme of distribution that
                      will ensure your intentions are carried out and that satisfies the legal and moral obligations that
                      the law imposes on testators, so as to minimize the risk of challenges to your Will.
                    </p>
                      <h2 class="intro-text">Powers of Attorney:</h2>
                      <p>
                      A power of attorney is a document which grants conduct of the grantors financial affairs and/or
                      property to a trusted individual such as a spouse.  They are an important tool in planning for
                      incapacity and can be limited or broad in their scope, depending on your needs.
                    </p>
                      <h2 class="intro-text">Representation Agreements</h2>
                      <p>
                      Representation Agreements allow people to choose, in advance, how, when and by whom
                      decisions about their health or personal care will be made if they become incapable of making
                      decisions independently.
                    </p>
                      <h2 class="intro-text">Administration</h2>
                      <p>
                      The legal position of an executor or administrator can be perilous.  We regularly act for clients to
                      obtain grant of letters probate or letters of administration and assist in the administration of
                      estates through to distribution.  I can also help to resolve disputes that can and often do arise over
                      the adequacy or interpretation of a Will or in the administration of an estate.
